I got asked in an interview recently to design a file upload feature. After the initial discussion, The interviewer asked if I can design for multiple threads. My thought was, As the network bandwidth is limited and the internet is connected through a serial data connection, the network bottleneck will kick-in much before the CPU bottleneck, and a multiple thread implementation would have a limited performance improvement. But the interviewer was hell bend on the multi-thread approach. What are the arguments in favor of a multi-thread upload approach? (I recently came to know that AWS has a library which permits uploads on multiple threads. So there should be some advantages I am unaware of.)
