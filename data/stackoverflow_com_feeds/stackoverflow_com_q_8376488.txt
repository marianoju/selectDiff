I want to add microseconds in the timestamp of each entry of my log files generated with log4j, is it possible ? I have searched in the official documentation but there are no mention of unit below the milliseconds.  Now i have a conversion pattern like the following :  %d{dd/MM/yyyy HH\:mm\:ss,SSS} %-5p [%t] - %m%n  in the date conversion pattern(%d) i want to add microseconds after the milliseconds value(SSS), is there a way to do it ?
