I am trying to copy files/folder from scaleway(object storage bucket) to google cloud bucket using gsutil  gsutil cp -R s3://scaleway-bucket gs://cloud-storage-bucket  and I am getting error :  AccessDeniedException: 403 InvalidAccessKeyId   InvalidAccessKeyIdThe AWS Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records. I have checked .boto file for the access and secret keys, entries are correct.  I think either I am missing something or doing it incorrectly. Thanks.
